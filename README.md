# Batppuccin

[![Build Status](https://github.com/bbatsov/batppuccin-emacs/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bbatsov/batppuccin-emacs/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

Batppuccin is an opinionated Emacs port of the [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) color scheme. It aims to follow the official Catppuccin style guide closely while being structured idiomatically for Emacs.

The name is a play on my last name ([Batsov](https://batsov.com/)) + Catppuccin (cat -> bat). So, that's essentially `@bbatsov`'s take on Catppuccin.[^1]

## Why Another Catppuccin Theme?

The [official catppuccin/emacs](https://github.com/catppuccin/emacs) port has some fundamental issues that are hard to fix incrementally:

### Architectural Problems

- Registers a single `catppuccin` theme and switches flavors via a global variable + reload function. This breaks standard `load-theme` workflows, theme-switching packages like `circadian.el`, and any tooling that expects one theme = one entry in `custom-theme-load-path`. Batppuccin defines four proper themes (`batppuccin-mocha`, `batppuccin-latte`, etc.) that work with `load-theme` out of the box.
- Loads color definitions from an external file using `load-file-name`, which is nil in certain `load-theme` code paths (e.g., when Emacs hasn't marked the theme as safe yet). This causes the theme to fail to load entirely for some users.
- No semantic color layer -- faces reference raw palette colors directly, making it hard to reason about color assignments or adjust them systematically.

I think this is partly because the official Emacs port uses Catppuccin's [Whiskers](https://github.com/catppuccin/toolbox/tree/main/whiskers) template tool to generate the Elisp from a `.tera` template. That's great for keeping ports in sync across editors, but it means the generated code doesn't follow Emacs conventions. It doesn't sit well with me.

### Style Guide Deviations

- `font-lock-variable-name-face` is set to the default text color, making variables indistinguishable from surrounding text. The style guide assigns distinct colors to variables and properties.
- All `outline-*` levels use the same blue, so org-mode headings and any outline-based hierarchy look flat. The style guide specifies a rainbow cycle (red, peach, yellow, green, sapphire, lavender).
- `org-block` forces a green foreground on all unstyled code inside source blocks, instead of inheriting the default text color.
- Search match highlighting uses aggressive red backgrounds where the style guide calls for teal.
- Minibuffer prompt uses a subdued gray (`subtext0`) instead of a prominent color.

### Placeholder Colors in Production

Multiple faces (dired+, diredfl, tree-sitter, whitespace, helm) are set to `#ff00ff` magenta as a "TODO" placeholder. These show up as literal hot pink in real usage.

### Missing Face Coverage

No support for vertico, marginalia, embark, transient, flycheck, doom-modeline, cider, corfu, or several other widely-used packages.

## Approach

Batppuccin follows the conventions established in [zenburn-emacs](https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs) and [emacs-tokyo-night-theme](https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs-tokyo-night-theme):

- **One theme file per flavor.** Each variant (`batppuccin-mocha-theme.el`, `batppuccin-latte-theme.el`, etc.) is a thin wrapper that loads the shared infrastructure and applies its palette. Standard Emacs theme machinery works without any special glue.
- **Shared infrastructure in `batppuccin.el`.** Color palettes for all four flavors, the face application function, and a `defcustom` for user color overrides all live in one file. Adding a new variant means defining a color alist and a ~10-line wrapper.
- **All 26 canonical Catppuccin colors** with exact hex values from the spec, plus derived colors for diff backgrounds, selection, cursor line, and the heading rainbow cycle.
- **Follows the Catppuccin style guide** for syntax highlighting (mauve for keywords, green for strings, blue for functions, peach for constants, sky for operators, yellow for types, overlay2 for comments, rosewater for the cursor) and editor UI (lavender for active line numbers, teal for search backgrounds, red/green/blue at low opacity for diffs).
- **Broad face coverage** out of the box -- built-in Emacs faces plus magit, vertico, corfu, marginalia, embark, orderless, consult, transient, flycheck, flymake, cider, company, evil, mu4e, notmuch, doom-modeline, treemacs, web-mode, and more.

## Installation

### MELPA

Batppuccin is available on [MELPA](https://melpa.org/#/batppuccin). Assuming
you've [configured MELPA](https://melpa.org/#/getting-started) as a package
source:

```
M-x package-install RET batppuccin RET
```

Then load any flavor:

```elisp
(load-theme 'batppuccin-mocha t)
```

Or with `use-package`:

```elisp
(use-package batppuccin
  :ensure t
  :config
  (load-theme 'batppuccin-mocha t))
```

### package-vc-install

```elisp
(package-vc-install "https://github.com/bbatsov/batppuccin-emacs")
(load-theme 'batppuccin-mocha t)
```

### use-package (with package-vc)

```elisp
(use-package batppuccin
  :vc (:url "https://github.com/bbatsov/batppuccin-emacs" :rev :newest)
  :config
  (load-theme 'batppuccin-mocha t))
```


### straight.el

```elisp
(straight-use-package
 '(batppuccin-latte-mocha :host github :repo "bbatsov/batppuccin-emacs"))
(load-theme 'batppuccin-mocha t)
```

Or with `use-package` integration.

```elisp
(use-package batppuccin-mocha
  :straight (:host github :repo "bbatsov/batppuccin-emacs")
  :config (load-theme 'batppuccin-mocha t))
```

### From source

Clone the repo and add it to your load path:

```elisp
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "/path/to/batppuccin-emacs")
(load-theme 'batppuccin-mocha t)
```

## Flavors

| Flavor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `batppuccin-mocha` | The darkest variant |
| `batppuccin-macchiato` | Dark |
| `batppuccin-frappe` | Medium-dark |
| `batppuccin-latte` | Light |

## Customization

Override any color across all flavors:

```elisp
(setq batppuccin-override-colors-alist
      '(("bat-base" . "#000000")
        ("bat-text" . "#ffffff")))
```

The override alist takes precedence over the built-in palette. Color names match the canonical Catppuccin names with a `bat-` prefix (e.g., `bat-rosewater`, `bat-mauve`, `bat-surface0`).

Disable heading scaling if you prefer uniform sizes in org, markdown, shr, and info:

```elisp
(setq batppuccin-scale-headings nil)
```

After changing any of these options, run `M-x batppuccin-reload` to apply them without restarting Emacs.

## Interactive Commands

- `M-x batppuccin-select` -- pick a flavor interactively and load it
- `M-x batppuccin-reload` -- reload the current theme after changing options
- `M-x batppuccin-list-colors` -- display all palette colors with samples (prefix arg to pick a variant)

## Programmatic Access

If you need to reference theme colors in your own configuration, there are a couple of options.

Look up a single color:

```elisp
(batppuccin-get-color "bat-blue")
```

Or bind the entire palette as local variables with `batppuccin-with-colors`:

```elisp
(batppuccin-with-colors
  (set-face-attribute 'some-face nil :foreground bat-blue))
```

You can also hook into theme loads with `batppuccin-after-load-hook` -- each function receives the theme name as its argument:

```elisp
(add-hook 'batppuccin-after-load-hook
          (lambda (_theme)
            (batppuccin-with-colors
              (set-face-attribute 'my-face nil :foreground bat-teal))))
```

## Automatic Light/Dark Switching

Batppuccin pairs well with packages that switch themes based on the time of
day or your OS appearance setting:

- [auto-dark](https://github.com/LionyxML/auto-dark-emacs) tracks your OS
  dark/light mode and switches themes to match:

```elisp
(use-package auto-dark
  :config
  (setq auto-dark-themes '((batppuccin-mocha) (batppuccin-latte)))
  (auto-dark-mode 1))
```

- [circadian](https://github.com/guidoschmidt/circadian.el) switches on a
  time-based schedule (e.g. sunrise/sunset):

```elisp
(use-package circadian
  :config
  (setq circadian-themes '((:sunrise . batppuccin-latte)
                            (:sunset  . batppuccin-mocha)))
  (circadian-setup))
```

See [Automatic Light/Dark Theme Switching](https://emacsredux.com/blog/2026/03/29/automatic-light-dark-theme-switching/)
for a deeper look at both approaches.
